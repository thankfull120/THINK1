<h2>PSALM </h2>

<p>Hymns[edit]
Hymns, songs of praise for God's work in creation or history.<br>
 They typically open with a call to praise, describe the motivation for praise, and conclude with a repetition of the call. <p>
   Two sub-categories are "enthronement psalms", celebrating the enthronement of Yahweh as king,<p>
      and Zion psalms, glorifying Mount Zion, God's dwelling-place in Jerusalem.[9]
      <p> Gunkel also described a special subset of "eschatological hymns"[10]
        <p> which includes themes of future restoration (Psalm 126) or of judgment (Psalm 82).[11]<p>

  My Utmost for His Highest.<a/> "Clouds and darkness"
 <br><p> "Clouds and darkness surround Him...(Psalm 97:2)" A person who has no been
 born again by the Spirit of God will tell you that <u>the teachings of Jesus are simple</u><p>
<p>When we come into close contact with the teachings of Jesus Christ we have our first realization of this.<p>
The only possible way to have full understanding of the teachings of Jesus is throught the<br>
light of the Spirit of God shining inside us.<p>
If we have never had the experience of taking our casual, religious shoes off our casual<br> When we
think seriously</br> about what it will cost others if we obey the call of Jesus, we tell God He
doesn't know what our obedience will mean.<p> Keep to the point--He does know.<h3> Shut our every othersthought and keep yourself before God in this obediencething
only--my utmost for His highest.</h3><p> I am determined to be absolutelyu and entirely for Him and Him alone

 My Unstoppable Determination for His Holiness. <br><br>"Whether it means life or death==it makes no difference!"
<strong>(see 1:21).</strong> <p>Paul was determined that nothing would stop him from doing exactly what God wanted.
But before we choose to follow God's will, a crisis must develop in our lives,
This happens because we tend to be unresponsive to God's gentler nudges.<br><br> He brings us
to the place where He asks us to be out utmost for Him and we begin to debate. <p>He then providentially produces a crisis where
we have to decide--for or against. <p>That moment becomes a great crossroads in our lives. If a crisis has come to you on any front,
surrender your will to Jesus absolutely and irrevocably
