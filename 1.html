<p>"...my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed,
 but with all boldness, as always,</p>
 so now also <u>Christ will be magnified </u>in my body, <strong
 >whether body life or by death"</strong><br><br>
 (Philippiansa 1:20)<p>

  My Utmost for His Highest.<a/> "... my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing
 I shall be ashamed....:<P> We will all feel very much ashamed if we do not yeld to Jesus the
 areas of our lives He has asked us to yield to Him.<br><p> It's as if Paul were saying,<u><P> "My determined
 purpose is to be my utomost for His highest--my best for His glory."</u>
<p>To reach that level of determination is a matter of the will, not of debate or of
reasoning.<P> It is absolute and irrevocable surrender of the will at that point.<p>
An undue amount of thought and consideration for ourselves is what keeps us from making that
decision,<br> although we cover it up with the pretense that it is others we are considering.<br> When we
think seriously</br> about what it will cost others if we obey the call of Jesus, we tell God He
doesn't know what our obedience will mean.<p> Keep to the point--He does know.<h3> <P>Shut our every othersthought and keep yourself before God in this obediencething
only--my utmost for His highest.</h3><p> I am determined to be absolutelyu and entirely for Him and Him alone

 My Unstoppable Determination for His Holiness. <br><br>"Whether it means life or death==it makes no difference!"
<strong>(see 1:21).</strong> <p>Paul was determined that nothing would stop him from doing exactly what God wanted.<p>
But before we choose to follow God's will, a crisis must develop in our lives,<br>
This happens because we tend to be unresponsive to God's gentler nudges.<br><br> He brings us
to the place where He asks us to be out utmost for Him and we begin to debate. <p>He then providentially produces a crisis where
we have to decide--for or against. <p>That moment becomes a great crossroads in our lives.<P> If a crisis has come to you on any front,
surrender your will to Jesus absolutely and irrevocably
