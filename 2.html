<p>Habiru[edit]
Main article: Habiru
Since the discovery of the second millennium inscriptions mentioning the Habiru,
 there have been many theories linking these to the Hebrews.<p>
   Some scholars argue that the name "Hebrew" is related to the name of the seminomadic Habiru people,<p>
   who are recorded in Egyptian inscriptions of the 13th and 12th centuries BCE as having settled in Egypt.<p>
     [17] This is rebutted by others who propose that the Hebrews are mentioned in older texts of the 3rd <br>
     Intermediate Period of Egypt (15th century BCE) as Shasu of Yhw.[18]<p>
        Writing in 1989, Anson F. <p>
          Rainey concluded that attempts to relate apiru (Habiru) to the Hebrew word ibri (Hebrews) were "wishful thinking."[19]<p>

  My Utmost for His Highest.<a/> Will you go out without knowing?<p>
    "he went out, not knowing where he was going (Hebrews 11:8)""<p>

      Have you ever "gone out" in this way" <p>
        If so, there is no logical answer possible when anyone<br>
        asks you what you are doing.<p>
          "What do you expect to do?"<p>
        You don't know what you knows what He is doing. <p>
          Continually examine your in every area of yhour life, trusting in God entirely.<p>

 <br><p>It ks this attitude that keeps you in constant wonder,<br> because you don't know what God is going to do next. ,<u> "My determined
 purpose is to be my utomost for His highest--my best for His glory."</u>
<p>To reach that level of determination is a matter of the will, not of debate or of
reasoning. It is absolute and irrevocable surrender of the will at that point.<p>
An undue amount of thought and consideration for ourselves is what keeps us from making that
decision, although we cover it up with the pretense that it is others we are considering.<br> When we
think seriously</br> about what it will cost others if we obey the call of Jesus, we tell God He
doesn't know what our obedience will mean.<p> Keep to the point--He does know.<h3><p> Shut our every othersthought and keep yourself before God in this obediencething
only--my utmost for His highest.</h3><p> I am determined to be absolutelyu and entirely for Him and Him alone

 My Unstoppable Determination for His Holiness. <br><br>"Whether it means life or death-it makes no difference!"
<strong>(see 1:21).</strong> <p>Paul was determined that nothing would stop him from doing exactly what God wanted.<p>
But before we choose to follow God's will,<br> a crisis must develop in our lives,<br>
This happens because we tend to be unresponsive to God's gentler nudges.<br><br> He brings us
to the place where He asks us to be out utmost for Him and we begin to debate. <p>He then providentially produces a crisis where
we have to decide--for or against. <p>That moment becomes a great crossroads in our lives. <p>If a crisis has come to you on any front,<br>
surrender your will to Jesus absolutely and irrevocably
